# ClusterLong
Support to clustering longitudinal data with sparse (very little observed points for each subject) and irregular (the observation occassions are not aligned across subjects) observations. Longitudinal data with multiple outcomes is supported as well, where some of them could be pure noise (non-distinguishable). Support the case with potentially unbalanced cluster size, i.e., the number of subjects in some clusters are way outnumbered by the others.

## Installation
To install the package: 
devtools::install_github("junyzhou10/ClusterLong")

## Usage
Use main function LongDataCluster(x, Y, id, ...) to cluster longitudinal data in long format. Parallel computing is supported by specifying parallel = TRUE. 

\textbold{DendroPlot(Cluster.object)} yields corresponding dendrogram, where Cluster.object is the output from LongDataCluster()

MeanPlot(Cluster.object) yields corresponding mean curves of each detected cluster.
