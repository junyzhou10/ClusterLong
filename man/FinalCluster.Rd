\title{Ancillary function for parallel computing (not for call)}
\usage{
FinalCluster(pure.leaf, stop = 1, weight.func, DistMetric)
}
\arguments{
\item{pure.leaf}{Output from LongDataCluster.core in each server}

\item{stop}{When iteratively applying parallel idea, stop when a certain number of clusters are left}

\item{weight.func}{weight function}

\item{DistMetric}{Weighted or Unweighted distance metric}
}
\value{
The same output as LongDataCluster.core
}
\description{
Based on outputs from each server/slave, merge them and keep hierarchical algorithm until only one group left
}
